# Motor-Control
Repo for stepper motor control in remote TCD automation.

This is an Arduino-based project built with the purpose of automating stepper motors to position a Transcranial Doppler probe during experimentation, with the express purpose of optimizing signal strength. Primarily relies on the Stepper.h Arduino library for motor control. 

See figures for motor configuration.
